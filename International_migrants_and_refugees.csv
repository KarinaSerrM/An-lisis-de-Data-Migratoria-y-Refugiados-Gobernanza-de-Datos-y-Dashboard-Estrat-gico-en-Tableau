Based on the verification results, UNHCR reported on at least 145 persons at risk of statelessness and 460 in a statelessness like situation. During first half of 2023, their number decreased to the total number of 476 persons at risk of statelessness at the end of June 2023. In 2018 Montenegro introduced formal statelessness determination procedure in its legal system.

In previous years, this figure has been calculated by adding all grants of stateless leave. This resulted in unavoidable double counting for stateless individuals who were applying for further statelessness leave after the expiry of their initial grant of leave. The UK Government has now provided data for initial and subsequent grants. The subsequent grants have therefore been removed from the previous cumulative figure between 2013 - 2018. Since 2019, the cumulative figure now only includes initial grants of leave following individuals’ recognition as stateless. At the mid 2023, the total number of individuals recognised under UK’s statelessness determination procedure is 349. UNHCR further provides the number of asylum-seekers and refugees whose nationality has been recorded as ‘stateless’ as part of the asylum process. For this group there has been no formal determination that they are stateless.","United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Geneva, UNHCR Population Statistics Database, last accessed May 2024."
